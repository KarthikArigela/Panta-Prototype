# Post from one of the YC Founder

Forget your resume.
18 YC founders told me what actually gets you hired.

Over the past three weeks, I interviewed 18 early-stage startups in SF looking for founding team members.

The answer: Can they figure things out.

One founder's best early ops hire graduated with a food science degree and no business experience.

Another found their cracked founding engineer at a hackathon. Still in college. No Big Tech pedigree.

Another's secret social media weapon was a high schooler who earned the role by going viral on day one.

What these successful hires had in common:
- They consistently shipped
- They learned unnaturally fast. 
- They took feedback without ego. 
- They never made the same mistake twice.
- They owned problems without being asked. 

The through-line? Nearly all of these candidates had experienced real failure somewhere in their past. Personal, professional, academic. And they kept going anyway.

Founders said this was the single highest predictor of success as a founding team hire.

So if you're considering joining a founding team, stop polishing your resume.

Go build something. Ship it broken. Fix it in public.

What are you waiting for? Go ship something this week that would say more than your resume ever could.


# Some Designer Founder telling his story and How he would start from scratch. (Take the Social Media Part)

Hey, this is Satya. I’m 21 years old and founder of one of the fastest growing design studio - Kree8, and have my own SaaS product - Sprrrint.

I  have 43k followers on X and about to reach $100k/m, but exactly a year ago:
I had 0 followers on X and was making $0/m. I probably didn’t even think X is for creatives. So I wouldn’t waste much time and talk straight to the point what this article is about.
This is the message I sent to one of the designer when I was starting, so can say I was exactly in your position last year:

So what would I do if I am starting again from 0.
1st I’ll focus on growing my followers and skills, and the money will 100% follow. Tbh, if you have great design skills, pls reach out. I’m ready to pay $6–8k/m.  Yeah so anyway…

Here's what you'll find in this article:
- How I'll grow my followers
- How I'll improve your skills from zero
- How I'll reach $10k/m fast

SO LET'S START!
Here’s how I’ll grow my followers:
Ⅰ. Game of Observation
First, I’ll start observing viral posts on X and save them on a separate bookmark folder.
Here are some viral types of content I observed:

1. Hot takes / unpopular opinions (big reach)
These spark replies + quote tweets = algorithm juice.
Examples:
“99% of landing pages don’t need animations. They need clarity.”
“If your SaaS needs a video to explain it, the UX already failed.”
“Design systems are useless if your PM ignores them.”
Why it works: People argue. X loves arguments.
Format tip:
One sharp sentence. No emojis. No hashtags.
2.  Before → After design transformations (insane saves)

Examples:
“Redesigned this landing page in 2 hours. Here’s what I changed ”
“Client said conversions were bad. The problem was obvious.”
What to show:
Slide 1: ugly / messy version
Slide 2: clean redesign
In Thread: why each change mattered (Optional)
Why it works: Visual + proof = instant credibility.
3. “Steal this” frameworks (bookmark magnets)
People LOVE saving these.

Examples:
“I use this landing page structure for every SaaS client”
“My exact process for pricing page design”
“The only hero section formula you need”
Format:
Numbered list (5–7 points)
Short lines
No fluff
Goal: Saves > likes.
4.  Calling out bad design (roast content)
Examples:
“This checkout flow loses money. Here’s why.”
“Great product, terrible onboarding.”
Rules:
Critique the design, not the brand/team
Always explain how to fix it
This builds authority without being toxic.

....and many more.
ⅠⅠ. Then I’ll create content something like that but with my own design or twist
I’m not reposting or plagiarizing.
I’m rebuilding proven ideas through my own lens.
Same structure, different:
opinion
examples
visuals
tone
If a format worked once, it’ll work again - if the insight is original.
This saves time and removes guesswork. I’m not experimenting blindly; I’m iterating on what already works.
Think of it as:
“Steal the frame, not the painting.”
Here are few examples of my post which went super viral when I followed the same structure and content style:

ⅠⅠⅠ. Post it with an engaging caption like “Did I cook” (optional & controversial)
Captions aren’t decoration - they’re conversation starters.
Short, slightly controversial hooks like:
“Did I cook?”
“Am I wrong for this?”
“This might be a bad take…”
…lower the barrier for replies.
Replies > likes. Replies = reach.
Some people will love it, some will hate it  and that’s fine.
Neutral posts die. Opinionated posts travel.
4. Post 2–3 times a day
X rewards volume + consistency, especially when you’re growing.
Posting multiple times:
Increases surface area
Lets you test different ideas fast
Removes emotional attachment to one post
Not every post needs to go viral.
One hit can carry 10 average posts.
The goal isn’t perfection - it’s momentum.
So this is the only thing you need to know to grow your X account fast. but in this process don't forget to create or post  something that you want, not for the likes not for the engagement, that'll help you stand out and makes you happy, that's important.

And also no need to be the reply guy, I mean it can help but I've never replied to other's post for growing followers, and I'm doing pretty great ;)
Here’s how I’ll improve my skills (For Beginners)
I. Start with ONE tool (Figma)
Don’t try to “learn design” in theory.
Design is a skill - you learn it by doing.
Pick one tool (Figma) and get comfortable with it:
Watch 20–40 mins of tutorials daily
Learn only what you need to move shapes, text, and frames
That’s enough to begin.
II. Learn the real basics (not everything)
Before fancy effects, focus on fundamentals:
Color usage (contrast > aesthetics)
Gradients & shadows (subtle, not decorative)
Typography (font size, weight, spacing)
Visual hierarchy (what should be seen first?)
These skills will keep you ahead of 90% of designers on X
III. Practice by recreating real designs
The fastest way to learn is copying with intention.
Recreate real apps or websites
Redesign screens you admire
Even copy my designs if it helps - for practice only
You’re training your eye, not your originality (yet).
Bonus:
Do challenges like 30 days, 30 designs
Consistency beats talent early on
Ⅳ. Ask for feedback 
Design improves faster with outside eyes.
Post your work on X
Ask clearly: “What looks off here?”
Tag designers you admire and ask for honest feedback
Don’t defend your work.
V. Work on your own opinionated projects
Now comes the real growth.
Find websites or apps you think look bad
Redesign them the way you think they should be
Show before → after
Post these on X.
This does three things:
Sharpens your design thinking
Builds your personal brand
Attracts real clients organically
That’s it. No courses. No secrets. Just reps.
Design isn’t learned by watching.
it’s learned by shipping, fixing, and shipping again.
How I'll reach $10k/m fast
So now I have some followers and skills, and expect that you are also here, now comes the most important thing - Money.

And tbh if you doing what I said, recreating viral contents and posting 2-3x  day on X, You don't have to do anything specific now, the clients will reach out to you in your DMs  for works.

When I hit 3k followers, I already started getting many leads without doing any cold dms or anything.
But still you can do these things to increase the chances more:
I. Improve big brands publicly (roast or before → after)
Instead of saying “I’m good at design”, I’d show it.
Pick well-known brands or SaaS products
Redesign one key screen or landing section
Share it as a before → after or light roast
This does two things:
Builds instant credibility
Attracts founders who already have money
Good work + public distribution = inbound leads.
II. Talk openly about money
Designers avoid money talk.
That’s exactly why it works.
Share what you charged
Share how long it took
Share how fast it scaled
Example:
“This project paid $4,000 and took 3 days.”
This reframes you from designer → business asset.
High-paying clients notice this immediately.
III. Show client love + real outcomes
Don’t just post testimonials. Post what changed.
Share:
What was broken
What you fixed
What happened after
Example:
“Client was stuck on their landing page for weeks.
We redesigned it in 2 days.
They shipped the same week and started getting demos.”
Clients don’t care about colors.
They care about speed, clarity, and results.
Closing truth
$10k/month doesn’t come from being the best designer.
It comes from being the most visible, trusted, and easy to hire.
Show your work.
Talk about money.
Make success obvious.
And if you don’t have clients yet, create fake ones.
Early on, I designed full projects on my own and presented them like real-world briefs.

This helped potential clients see my thinking, execution, and how a project would look if we worked together - which built trust before I had social proof.

That’s my entire approach.
I’ll grow my audience by learning from what already works.
I’ll sharpen my skills by practicing publicly and asking for feedback.
And I’ll make money by showing real proof, real speed, and real outcomes.

Thank you for reading this article and hope it helped you. Reach out to me if you want to ask some specific questions or tag me if need any help, I'll try my best to help you.

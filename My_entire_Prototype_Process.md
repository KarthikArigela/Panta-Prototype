# Process to Create Prototype Value-Based Work for YC Companies

(1) Tool — Google AI mode.

Google Searching the "Keywords" of that Company & First Principles of the Company & the Domain they are Operating. The Goal is to Understand the Basics & Terminology of that Industry Domain. First principles include (why, what, how, where, when, who etc).

(2) Tool — Google Gemini App.

Create a Text file, which has all the landing page copy writing text in the file which helps us understand what they are actually focused on.

Mostly likely you haven't just read the Broad Industry Domain knowledge from above, but from the Landing page copy text, you will understand the exact problem that they are trying to solve.

Note: Always Cross Verify the AI generated thoughts with Google AI mode with Valid Documented proofs. So that you are backed by original data but not random AI hallucinations.

Few prompts to understand the depth:

Consider AI as Expert of that Field with 100 years of Experience, the gradual change in the field, what are the chances of this startup succeeding, Getting details of getting Acquired by other top Firms. Ask it to read about the Startup via google search & tell me the Scenarios that can occur & kind of Business Future telling based on history experienced by him.

SWOT Analysis of startup. Mistakes that they are doing now in the Early stage.

Target Audience demographics & Basic ICP of the Startup Buying people.

Take a Niche/Sub Niche of their Target Audience. Ask AI to act as One & Search the web, Reddit, G2, Capterra, & other User testimonials for Actual User Journey of the current on-ground practical processes happening to that users. Create a detailed prompt with this through prompt makers.

Now construct User Journey, Create a Very Simple User Journey like Explain like 5 years old & gradual further into depth of the key things needed to move across the process.

Understand the Current Ongoing practical User Journey without our startup & How the process gets Simplified (or) more impactful with our startup & what is the New process of It. Using landing page Data. New process that should be carried by the startup.

Now after Understanding the 'Current Vs New processes', act yourself as the 'Startup Owner' trying to solve it yourself, Ask How should you start Building the product. What is the Easy Build, High Impact feature in the Entire process as prototype. what is it & reasoning behind it: —> This is what you should build as prototype: with detailed Architecture to Build.

After you Improve upon the Prototype Idea by asking More questions, for Specific Niche, Ask for detailed Architecture, How to Build & Why & Discuss about it.

(3) Tool — Claude Code + Google Antigravity IDE.

Files to be added as Context.

- Landing page copy text.

- Rough File of all the Research done in chatbots.

- Draft files to Submit.

- Actual file to be sent to the Founder.

Prompt is: Given all the raw data, My prompts to chatbots & the responses to understand what I wanted to do for Prototype for the Founders of [Startup] to get a Job as Founding Engineer. This rough doc has all the details & Now I should build the prototype with [Prototype Idea you got].

The goal is to understand the raw data from this file & write a New document specifically to [Startup] Founders in my voice, to show that I have done a lot of work, understanding the domain, I also have Product Engineering + Customer understanding which is Crucial to join as Founding Engineer who is typically a Generalist what they are looking.

Focus only on Pitch Doc deliverable doc. Let's think about prototype later, Here are my [Voice & Tone details].

Make sure that the prototype way of architecture that you are Building Right & is included in the Right way in the Pitch Document.

Though my Voice is given, the end target Audience is the [Startup] Founders. Make sure that you Complete the Draft & Reread the entire doc and verify whether the [Startup] Founders would love this Document enough that looking at it, they Offer me the job. If not, Understand the issues & reloop & reiterate the process till it was satisfied.

**By Now you will get the Pitch Document + Prototype Architecture to Build**

(4) Tool — Google AntiGravity & Claude Code. 
Goal is to Use Ralph Wiggum loop with Creating PRD & PRD.json User stories & Acceptance Criteria to automate the product development autonomously.

Spend time understanding what Ralph Loop is & How to trigger it.

Gather all the necessary details & Generate them.

- Rough First Draft pitch Doc —> Final Pitch Doc.

- ICP Complete Indepth Details using ICP Skill.

Gather Brand Identity Guidelines of [Startup] Via Google Ponelli & Figma Color Selection. Then Use these Data to Create a Brief Brand Identity Guidelines Md file.

Now start Building the Rough PRD for Ralph loop. Casual Conversation/typed text freely what you want. Refine the Requirements with External POV like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk whether they are satisfied with the product or not.

Then Construct the Actual PRD using PRD Skill by Ralph Github Repo files. Verify the PRD & make changes Needed.

Convert that PRD file into PRD.json file. Use Ralph Github Repo file to get Sizeable User stories & Acceptance criteria to Understand & Refine.

Once PRD & PRD.json is Completed with Reviews, Run the Ralph loop to Complete all the User stories to execute. The Ralph loop will take care of the Github commits, hosting & Branch if Correct Branch details are given.

Then the First prototype is published in the Vercel hosting for Feedback. This is the First Internal version. The goal is to take as much Feedback as possible from different perspectives & most importantly from the ICPs. For this prototype, I have given the Simulated ICP details file to Claude chrome to think like one & Find out the issues & improvements Options. That's it.

The No. of iterations you go, the better it becomes & closer to the customers.

After the prototype got the required outcome, package it up with Github & Custom Link & Focus on Documenting the work you have done. Describe the improvements that you have done in this process.

Add relevant demo input data in the prototype. So that User / Prototype Viewer will understand the product easily.

**Note:** This is the first step and Ideally, The prototype should not have long list of questions as present in current demo though goal is to complete the insurance application in 10 minutes. Since Getting APIs is kind of tedious for me, I took this route. But Ideally, we should get the APIs & make it seamless.

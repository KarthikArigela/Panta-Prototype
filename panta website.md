The reality

One guy falls off a ladder.
Your entire business is on the line.
01
Workers comp rates are brutal. And non-negotiable.
Roofing. Electrical. Framing. The trades with the most skill have the highest rates. You can't avoid workers comp—but you can avoid overpaying if you work with a broker who knows how to class your payroll correctly.

02
GCs demand certificates. Subs need to be covered.
You can't bid the job without the right coverage. Your subs need to carry their own policies. Additional insured requirements change project to project. You need a broker who can turn around certificates fast—not in two weeks.

03
Completed operations claims show up years later.
You finished the job three years ago. Now there's water damage and your name's on the permit. Completed operations coverage is what protects you after you've cashed the check and moved on. Most contractors don't realize they need it until they're getting sued.

"We place contractors every day. We know which carriers understand the trades—and which ones will drop you after your first claim."

The reality

You're running a legal business.
Most insurers still treat you like you're not.
01
Banks say no. Carriers follow.
Federal Schedule I classification means most major carriers won't even look at your application. You're left scrambling for coverage from whoever will talk to you.

02
Your inventory is worth more than most businesses.
A single grow room can hold six figures of product. Standard property policies weren't built for this. If something goes wrong, you need coverage that actually pays.

03
The rules change. Constantly.
Every state has different requirements. Every year brings new regulations. You need a broker who's tracking this full-time, not one who's Googling it when you call.

"We work exclusively with E&S markets that understand cannabis. Not because it's trendy—because it's the only way to get you real coverage."

Why Surplus Lines?
The Surplus Lines (E&S) market exists for risks that admitted insurance carriers decline to cover. This includes businesses in high-risk industries, operations in catastrophe-prone areas, companies with adverse claims history, or simply unique business models that don't fit standard underwriting boxes.

As a licensed California Surplus Lines Broker (License #4512382), Panta has access to dozens of non-admitted carriers who specialize in these hard-to-place risks. Unlike admitted carriers who must use state-approved rates and forms, surplus lines insurers can offer customized policy terms and pricing tailored to your specific situation.

The trade-off: Surplus Lines policies are not covered by state guaranty funds. That's why Panta only works with financially strong, A-rated carriers who have demonstrated stability through market cycles.

Surplus Lines & E&S Insurance
California Insurance Requirements
Coverage & Policies
Working with Panta
Surplus Lines & E&S Insurance
What is Surplus Lines (E&S) insurance?
Surplus Lines insurance, also called Excess & Surplus (E&S) or non-admitted insurance, provides coverage for risks that standard admitted carriers decline to insure. These include high-risk businesses, unique operations, or industries where admitted market capacity has contracted. E&S insurers are regulated differentlyâ€”they are not backed by state guaranty funds but offer flexibility in policy terms and pricing that admitted carriers cannot.
Why was my business declined by admitted insurers?
Admitted carriers decline coverage for various reasons: your industry may be classified as high-risk (cannabis, nightclubs, certain contractors), you may have a claims history, operate in a catastrophe-prone area (California wildfire zones, Florida hurricane coast), or your business model may be unique. Being declined does not mean you are uninsurableâ€”it means you need a broker who specializes in the surplus lines market.
Is Surplus Lines insurance legitimate and regulated?
Yes. Surplus Lines insurers are legitimate, financially vetted companies. While they are not "admitted" (licensed) in every state they operate, they must be approved on each state's eligible surplus lines insurer list. In California, they must appear on the List of Approved Surplus Line Insurers (LASLI). Panta only places coverage with A-rated or higher carriers.
What is the difference between admitted and non-admitted insurance?
Admitted insurers are licensed by the state, must use state-approved policy forms and rates, and their policyholders are protected by the state guaranty fund if the insurer becomes insolvent. Non-admitted (surplus lines) insurers are not state-licensed, can offer customized policy terms and competitive rates for hard-to-place risks, but are not backed by guaranty funds. Trade-off: flexibility vs. safety net.
What happens if my E&S insurer goes insolvent?
Unlike admitted carriers, surplus lines insurers are not covered by state guaranty funds. However, Panta only places coverage with financially strong, A-rated carriers that have demonstrated stability. We evaluate insurer financial strength and surplus as part of our placement process to minimize this risk.
California Insurance Requirements
Is Panta licensed in California?
Yes. Panta Insurance Services is a licensed California Surplus Lines Broker (License #4512382). We are authorized to place coverage with non-admitted insurers for California businesses when admitted market options are unavailable or inadequate.
What disclosures are required for California Surplus Lines policies?
California Insurance Code Section 1765 requires that policyholders receive written disclosure that: (1) the insurer is not admitted in California, (2) the policy is not covered by the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA), and (3) the policyholder may file complaints with the California Department of Insurance. Panta provides these disclosures on every surplus lines policy.
Are there taxes on California Surplus Lines policies?
Yes. California imposes a 3% Surplus Lines Tax on premiums for policies covering California risks, plus a 0.18% stamping fee collected by the Surplus Line Association of California (SLA). These taxes are itemized on your policy and remitted to the state by Panta.
Can I get coverage for my California wildfire zone property?
Yes. As admitted carriers have exited high-risk wildfire zones, the E&S market has become a critical source of property coverage for California businesses in these areas. Panta works with multiple surplus lines carriers who actively write wildfire-exposed commercial property. Coverage availability depends on your specific location, construction type, and risk mitigation measures.
What is the California FAIR Plan and how does it relate to E&S?
The California FAIR Plan is a state-mandated insurer of last resort for property coverage. It provides basic fire coverage when no other option exists. Many businesses use E&S surplus lines policies as their primary coverage because E&S can offer broader terms than FAIR Plan's limited coverage. Panta can help you evaluate whether E&S or FAIR Plan (or both) is appropriate for your situation.
Coverage & Policies
What types of businesses does Panta insure?
Panta specializes in hard-to-place commercial risks including: cannabis operations (dispensaries, cultivators, manufacturers), hospitality (bars, nightclubs, restaurants, hotels), fitness facilities (gyms, martial arts studios, climbing gyms), medical spas and aesthetics practices, childcare and daycare centers, contractors in high-risk trades, auto services (garages, body shops, tow trucks), food trucks and mobile vendors, pet services, tattoo and body art studios, and more.
What coverage types are available through Panta?
We place all major commercial lines through the E&S market: General Liability, Professional Liability (E&O), Commercial Property, Commercial Auto, Workers Compensation, Umbrella/Excess Liability, Product Liability, Liquor Liability, Cyber Liability, Directors & Officers (D&O), Employment Practices Liability (EPLI), Pollution Liability, Garagekeepers Liability, and more.
How long does it take to get a quote?
For standard submissions with complete information, we typically provide initial indications within 24-48 hours. Complex risks or those requiring multiple carrier submissions may take 3-5 business days. Panta's technology platform accelerates the submission and underwriting process compared to traditional brokers.
What information do I need to get a quote?
At minimum: business name, location(s), description of operations, revenue or payroll figures, and current coverage (if any). For specific coverage types, we may need: loss runs (claims history), vehicle schedules, employee counts, professional credentials, or property details. The more complete your submission, the faster and more accurate your quote.
Can I get a policy if I have prior claims?
Yes. The E&S market exists specifically for risks that standard carriers reject, including those with adverse claims history. While claims impact pricing and terms, they do not automatically disqualify you from coverage. Panta works with carriers who understand that claims happen and evaluate the whole picture of your risk.

How is Panta different from other insurance brokers?
Panta is a technology-enabled surplus lines brokerage built for speed and specialization. We focus exclusively on hard-to-place risks where we have deep market relationships and underwriting expertise. Our platform automates submission processing, carrier matching, and document handlingâ€”reducing the friction that makes traditional E&S placement slow and opaque.
What does it cost to work with Panta?
There is no fee to submit a risk or receive quotes. Panta earns a commission from the insurance carrier when we place coverageâ€”this is standard brokerage practice and does not increase your premium. E&S policies typically have higher premiums than admitted coverage due to the higher-risk nature of the business being insured, not because of broker fees.
What happens after I submit a quote request?
Within one business day, a Panta broker will review your submission for completeness and reach out with any clarifying questions. We then submit your risk to appropriate E&S carriers in our network. As quotes come in, we present options with our recommendations. Once you select coverage, we bind the policy and deliver your documents electronically.
Can Panta handle my renewals and ongoing service?
Yes. Panta provides full-service brokerage including renewals, policy changes (endorsements), certificates of insurance, and claims advocacy. We proactively review your coverage before renewal to ensure it still matches your operations and market your account to multiple carriers for competitive options.
What states does Panta operate in?
Panta is licensed in all 50 states. Our primary expertise is in California, Texas, Florida, and New Yorkâ€”states with large E&S markets and complex regulatory environments. We can place coverage for businesses operating in any U.S. state or with multi-state operations.

Our surplus lines specialists are here to help you find coverage for even the most challenging risks.

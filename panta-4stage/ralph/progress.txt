## Codebase Patterns
- TypeScript interfaces go in src/types/ directory
- Export interfaces AND default values for form initialization
- Use union types for finite sets (e.g., ViolationType, CargoType)
- Build command has pre-existing issues with /_global-error page - use `npx tsc --noEmit` for type checking
- ESLint has dependency issues - may need `npm install` to fix
- Use pnpm instead of npm - npm has semver issues with the project's eslint setup
- Zod validation schemas go in src/lib/validators.ts
- Export Zod-inferred types alongside schemas for type safety
- Use .refine() for conditional validation (e.g., hazmatTypes required when hazmat=true)
- Field naming follows camelCase convention
- Nullable boolean fields use `boolean | null` pattern for "not yet answered" state
- Hooks go in src/hooks/ directory
- Use useSyncExternalStore for SSR-safe localStorage hooks (avoids hydration mismatch)
- Pre-existing lint errors in page.tsx (setState in effect) - do not attempt to fix unless specifically tasked

## 2026-01-18 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created src/types/intake.ts with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
  - SmartIntakeData as the main form data interface combining all sections
  - Knockout interface with 6 boolean screening fields
  - RiskProfile interface with hazmat, radius, fleet, cargo, E&S market flags
  - Business interface with ACORD 125 fields (legal name, FEIN, DOT, MC, address, etc.)
  - Operations interface with safety programs, telematics, MVR checks
  - Vehicle interface with all vehicle details plus lienholder support
  - Driver interface with accidents and violations history
  - PriorInsurance, LossHistory, CoveragePreferences interfaces
  - Reusable sub-interfaces: Address, Claim, Violation, Accident
  - Type unions for finite sets: ViolationType, ClaimType, CargoType, HazmatType, EntityType, etc.
  - Default values for all interfaces for form initialization
  - StageProps generic interface for component props

- Files changed:
  - src/types/intake.ts (created - 666 lines)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The existing page.tsx has an inline FormData interface that will need to be migrated to use the new SmartIntakeData interface
  - Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck since there's no typecheck script defined
  - The build has pre-existing issues unrelated to types (React key warnings, /_global-error page error)
  - Knockout fields should use `boolean | null` to distinguish "not answered yet" from "answered No"
  - Vehicle and Driver interfaces support dynamic arrays for multiple entries
  - E&S market flags array in RiskProfile for tracking conditions that push applicant to Excess & Surplus market

## 2026-01-18 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Created src/lib/validators.ts with comprehensive Zod validation schemas
  - Added zod v3.23.8 dependency to package.json
  - knockoutSchema: 6 boolean fields with nullable for "not yet answered" state
  - riskProfileSchema: Conditional validation requiring hazmatTypes when hazmat=true
  - businessSchema: FEIN format (XX-XXXXXXX), DOT (7 digits), MC format validation
  - vehicleSchema: 17-character VIN validation with alphanumeric pattern (excluding I, O, Q)
  - driverSchema: Age validation (18-100), date format YYYY-MM-DD
  - addressSchema: Required street, city, state (2-char code), zip (5 or 9 digit)
  - smartIntakeSchema: Combines all sub-schemas for full form validation
  - All schemas export Zod-inferred types (e.g., BusinessInput, VehicleInput)
  - Stage validation helpers: validateKnockoutStage(), validateRiskProfileStage(), validateBusinessStage()
  - Switched to pnpm for package management due to npm semver issues

- Files changed:
  - src/lib/validators.ts (created - ~700 lines)
  - package.json (added zod dependency)
  - pnpm-lock.yaml (created - new lockfile)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - npm has semver issues with eslint in this project - use pnpm instead
  - Zod .refine() is perfect for conditional validation (e.g., "if A then B required")
  - Use z.literal('') with .or() to allow empty strings for optional fields with format validation
  - VIN validation excludes I, O, Q per industry standard
  - Export both schemas AND inferred types for React Hook Form integration
  - Stage validation helpers encapsulate business logic (e.g., knockout = any true answer blocks)

## 2026-01-18 - US-003
- What was implemented:
  - Created src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts with SSR-safe localStorage persistence
  - Uses useSyncExternalStore React 18+ pattern for proper SSR hydration
  - Debounced saves (2 second delay) to avoid performance issues during rapid form typing
  - Graceful JSON parse error handling with console warnings
  - Cross-tab synchronization via storage events
  - Also exported: useLocalStorageState (simpler useState-based version), clearLocalStorageKey, hasLocalStorageKey utilities
  - Full TypeScript generics support for type-safe storage

- Files changed:
  - src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts (created - 290 lines)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - useSyncExternalStore is the modern React 18+ way to sync external stores (like localStorage) with React
  - ESLint's react-hooks/refs rule prevents updating refs during render - use useEffect instead
  - ESLint's react-hooks/set-state-in-effect catches setState in effects - this is a pre-existing issue in page.tsx
  - The hook provides two versions: useLocalStorage (SSR-safe with storage events) and useLocalStorageState (simpler)
  - Storage event dispatch is needed for same-tab updates (native storage events only fire for other tabs)
